# Happyface Hawkers: a WebAR Application for DSTA Brainhack 2022

This project got to the finals in the competition (top 10)

Attempts were made wrt learning blender but then it kind of died. We still tried our best to make things look 3D though, e.g. by rotating the 2D surface (unlike the other hawker team).

Apparently a team that didn't change much from one of the tutorial templates ended up getting first place?

I should stop salting. Here's our pitch deck / script in presenter notes (idk if you can see it) if you want a rough idea what this is about
